# Overview

Please develop the application below using whatever framework you prefer (or not framework at all if that is your preference).

The test is estimated to take around two hours to complete, but it is ok if you take a bit longer.


Create a CLI calculator that performs the basic operations:
-	addition (+)
-	subtraction (-)
-	multiplication (*)
-	division (/)
-	square root (sqrt)


# Examples:

## Example 1:

(input)
5 + 2
(output)
7

Example 2:
(input)
10 x 5
(output)
50

Example 3:
(input)
9 sqrt
(output)
3

Acceptance criteria:

- Code should be returned as a git repository. Commit as often as you see fit.
- Unit tests covering any edge cases the developer considers important.

The developer will be rated for:

- Code works and performs all desired functionality.
- Appropriate unit test coverage.
- Clear code, good development principles.
- Easy to extend.
